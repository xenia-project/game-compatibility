# game-compatibility
If your favorite game isn't working on Xenia, the best way to prioritize it is to find it
in the game compatibility list and give the OP a **thumbs up reaction**. This allows
the developers to find popular games quickly.

If you've looked in the list and couldn't find your game - see the following section:

## Report/Issue Guidelines:
If you would like to submit a game-compatibility issue, please fill in the Game
Compatibility Report template, or else your issue will be closed.

### What NOT to post:
  * Piracy.
    * This should be common sense.
  * Issues that are empty, or don't edit/use the template whatsoever.
  * Non-English comments *except for posting untranslated comment alongside translated comment*.
  * Comments with bad spelling/grammar:
    * [Vulkan is a graphics API](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/). *Vulcan* is a species from Star Trek. *Vulcun* is related to eSports. *Vulkin* is an Undertale character. **Learn the difference.**
  * Non-game-specific Xenia issue(s).
  * Results not from [Xenia master](https://github.com/xenia-project/release-builds-windows/releases/latest) or [Xenia Canary](https://github.com/xenia-canary/xenia-canary/releases/tag/experimental).
  * Tech Support:
    * `How do I do/fix X?`
    * `How do I get games?`
    * `Why won't Xenia start?`
    * `Why is Xenia running slow/low FPS?` etc.
  * Begging:
    * `Please fix this/get it working/etc!`
    * `When/how will this be fixed?`
    * `This was my childhood game, please get it working.`
