# game-compatibility
If your favorite game isn't working on Xenia, the best way to prioritize it is to find it
in the game compatibility list and give the OP a **thumbs up reaction**. This allows
the developers to find popular games quickly.

If you've looked in the list and couldn't find your game - see the following section:
