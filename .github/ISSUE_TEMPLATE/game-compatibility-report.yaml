        #
        The Title ID of a game can be found in xenia.log after running the game;
        Search (<kbd>Ctrl+F</kbd> in most text editors) for `XEX_HEADER_EXECUTION_INFO`.

        If the game doesn't have an English title you may add a translation along with the original title.

        Please note original Xbox games are not supported; see [FAQ](https://github.com/xenia-project/xenia/wiki/FAQ#Can_Xenia_run_original_Xbox_games).
